# Exercise following the class

Create a git repository on https://github.com to put the work you've
done so far on the course. Initialise it with a README.md and an
R-specific .gitignore file.

Edit (and commit) the README.md with a summary statement of some sort
describing what the repository contains.

Add the work that you've done from the course; to date, that will be
the coding from
https://tomstafford.github.io/psy6422/coding-principles.html and the
markdown from https://tomstafford.github.io/psy6422/rmarkdown.html

Use git branches to tag the work (say as **Chapter5** and **Chapter6**, so
that you could see a version of the repository with only the coding
work from the first assignment, or a version with both of the
assignments.

Improve your code(1) on the **Chapter5** branch,
commit the changes on that branch (not on master) and git push that
branch to github.com. Tag the finished state of that branch with
ANOTHER branch (**Chapter5Polished**).


(1) Is your code perfect? If so, then just add a code comment saying
it's already perfect!
