# This is a short document about the hands-on part of the session

I'm going to cover, using both the terminal commands, and the RStudio
git interface, how to:

* git diff
* git add (to stage)
* git commit
* git push
* git pull
* git move
* git remove
* git checkout -b
* git merge

Although I've not documented everything I've done, this is all stuff
that you'll find in many online tutorials, including the Software
Carpentry tutorial, so you can easily research and review the commands
using the web.
