# Exercise following the class

Create a git repository on github.com to put the work you've done so
far on the course. Initialise it with a README.md and an R-specific
.gitignore file.

Add the work that you've done from the course, file by file.

Use git branches to tag the work, so that you could see a version of
the repository with only the work from the first assignment, or a
version with all of the assignments.

Improve, or make comments in one of the assignments on its own branch,
commit the changes on that branch (not on master) and git push that
branch to github.com. Tag the finished state of that branch with
ANOTHER branch.
