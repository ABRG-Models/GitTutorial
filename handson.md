# This is a short document about the hands-on part of the session

I'm going to cover, using both the terminal commands, and the RStudio
git interface, how to:

* git diff
* git add (to stage)
* git commit
* git push
* git pull
* git move
* git remove
* git checkout -b
* git merge
* Forking on github
* What could possibly go wrong?
* A talk through of some science that's on github

Although I've not documented everything I've done, these are common
commands that you'll find in the many online tutorials (including the
Software Carpentry tutorial mentioned in the talk slides), so you can
easily research and review the commands for the homework exercise.
